## C Programming - Basics

**Author**: `Ousama`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various basic programming concepts, including conditionals, loops, and character output using the `putchar` function.

## List of Programs

### 0. Positive or Negative
- This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The Last Digit
- This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number, along with its characteristics.

### 2. Print Alphabet
- This program prints the lowercase alphabet in one line, followed by a new line. It uses the `putchar` function.

### 3. Print Lowercase and Uppercase Alphabets
- This program prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by the uppercase alphabet, both in one line and separated by a new line. It uses the `putchar` function.

### 4. Print Alphabet without q and e
- This program prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', in one line, followed by a new line. It uses the `putchar` function.

### 5. Print Numbers
- This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

### 6. Print Numberz
- Similar to the previous program, this one prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. However, it does not use variables of type `char`.

### 7. Print Reverse Alphabet
- This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line, using the `putchar` function.

### 8. Print Hexadecimal
- This program prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, followed by a new line, using the `putchar` function.

### 9. Print Combinations of Single-Digit Numbers
- This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by a comma and space, in ascending order.

### 10. Print Combinations of Two Digits
- This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order, with the numbers separated by a comma and space.

### 11. Print Combinations of Three Digits
- This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits in ascending order, with the numbers separated by a comma and space.

### 12. Print Combinations of Two Two-Digit Numbers
- This advanced program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers in ascending order, with each combination separated by a comma and space.
