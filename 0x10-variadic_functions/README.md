## C Programming - Variadic Functions

**Author**: `OusamaTheCoder`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of variadic functions in C programming. Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. Each program focuses on a specific task that involves working with variadic functions.

## List of Programs

### 0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant
- This program defines a function that returns the sum of all its parameters. If the number of parameters is 0, it returns 0.

### 1. To be is to be the value of a variable
- This program defines a function that prints numbers followed by a new line. It can accept a variable number of integer parameters and allows you to specify a separator between the numbers.

### 2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable
- This program defines a function that prints strings followed by a new line. It can accept a variable number of string parameters and allows you to specify a separator between the strings. If a string is NULL, it prints "(nil)" instead.

### 3. To be is a to be the value of a variable
- This program defines a function that can print values of different data types. It uses a format string to specify the types of arguments passed to the function. Supported format specifiers include:
  - 'c' for char
  - 'i' for integer
  - 'f' for float
  - 's' for string (If the string is NULL, it prints "(nil)" instead)
  - Any other character is ignored.

Enjoy exploring these C programs related to variadic functions!
