## C Programming - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

**Author**: `Ousama`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various concepts related to more pointers, arrays, and strings. These programs cover topics such as string manipulation, integer manipulation, and buffer printing in the C programming language.

## List of Programs

### 0. strcat
- This program includes a function `_strcat` that concatenates two strings.

### 1. strncat
- This program includes a function `_strncat` that concatenates two strings, with a limit on the number of characters from the source string.

### 2. strncpy
- This program includes a function `_strncpy` that copies a string up to a specified number of characters.

### 3. strcmp
- This program includes a function `_strcmp` that compares two strings.

### 4. reverse_array
- This program includes a function `reverse_array` that reverses the content of an array of integers.

### 5. string_toupper
- This program includes a function `string_toupper` that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

### 6. cap_string
- This program includes a function `cap_string` that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.

### 7. leet
- This program includes a function `leet` that encodes a string into "1337" text.

### 8. rot13
- This program includes a function `rot13` that encodes a string using the ROT13 cipher.

### 9. print_number
- This program includes a function `print_number` that prints an integer.

### 10. Magic Addition
- This program adds a line of code to print a specific array element without modifying the original code.

### 11. Infinite Add
- This program includes a function `infinite_add` that adds two positive numbers represented as strings.

### 12. Buffer Printing
- This program includes a function `print_buffer` that prints the content of a buffer in a specified format.
