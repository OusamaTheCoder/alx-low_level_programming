## C Programming - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

**Author**: `Ousama`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings. These programs cover topics such as string manipulation, character searching, and matrix operations in the C programming language.

## List of Programs

### 0. memset
- This program includes a function `_memset` that fills memory with a constant byte.

### 1. memcpy
- This program includes a function `_memcpy` that copies memory area.

### 2. strchr
- This program includes a function `_strchr` that locates a character in a string.

### 3. strspn
- This program includes a function `_strspn` that gets the length of a prefix substring.

### 4. strpbrk
- This program includes a function `_strpbrk` that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

### 5. strstr
- This program includes a function `_strstr` that locates a substring.

### 6. Chess is mental torture
- This program includes a function `print_chessboard` that prints a chessboard.

### 7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire
- This program includes a function `print_diagsums` that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

### 8. Double pointer, double fun
- This program includes a function `set_string` that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

### 9. My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure
- This program contains the password for the `crackme2` executable.
