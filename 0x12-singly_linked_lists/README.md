## C Programming - Singly Linked Lists

**Author**: `OusamaTheCoder`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the concepts of singly linked lists in the C programming language. Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure used for storing and managing a collection of data elements.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts:

- When and why to use linked lists vs. arrays.
- How to build and use linked lists effectively.

## List of Tasks

### 0. Print list
- Implement a function `print_list` that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.

### 1. List length
- Write a function `list_len` that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.

### 2. Add node
- Create a function `add_node` that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.

### 3. Add node at the end
- Implement a function `add_node_end` that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.

### 4. Free list
- Write a function `free_list` that frees a `list_t` list.

### 5. The Hare and the Tortoise
- Create a function that prints a specific message before the `main` function is executed.

### 6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language
- Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints "Hello, Holberton," followed by a new line.

Each task is designed to enhance your understanding of linked lists and improve your programming skills.
