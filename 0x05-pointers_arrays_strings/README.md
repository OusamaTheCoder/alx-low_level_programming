## C Programming - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

**Author**: `Ousama`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings. These programs cover topics such as pointer manipulation, string manipulation, and array handling in the C programming language.

## List of Programs

### 0. 98 Battery st.
- This program includes a function `reset_to_98` that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
- This program includes a function `swap_int` that swaps the values of two integers.

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
- This program includes a function `_strlen` that returns the length of a string.

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
- This program includes a function `_puts` that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
- This program includes a function `print_rev` that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes
- This program includes a function `rev_string` that reverses a string.

### 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true
- This program includes a function `puts2` that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
- This program includes a function `puts_half` that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

### 8. Arrays are not pointers
- This program includes a function `print_array` that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### 9. strcpy
- This program includes a function `_strcpy` that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

### 10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers
- This program includes a function `_atoi` that converts a string to an integer.

### 11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code (Advanced)
- This program creates a password generator program `101-keygen.c` for the `101-crackme` program.

Enjoy exploring these C programs related to pointers, arrays, and strings!
