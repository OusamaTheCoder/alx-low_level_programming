## C Programming - More Functions, More Nested Loops

**Author**: `Ousama`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various concepts related to functions and nested loops. These programs cover topics such as character checking, multiplication, printing numbers, and more.

## List of Programs

### 0. isupper
- This program defines a function `_isupper` that checks if a character is uppercase and returns 1 if true, 0 otherwise.

### 1. isdigit
- This program defines a function `_isdigit` that checks if a character is a digit (0 through 9) and returns 1 if true, 0 otherwise.

### 2. Collaboration is multiplication
- This program defines a function `mul` that multiplies two integers.

### 3. The numbers speak for themselves
- This program defines a function `print_numbers` that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line, using `_putchar` only twice.

### 4. I believe in numbers and signs
- This program defines a function `print_most_numbers` that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4, followed by a new line, using `_putchar` only twice.

### 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
- This program defines a function `more_numbers` that prints the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times, followed by a new line, using `_putchar` only three times.

### 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
- This program defines a function `print_line` that prints a straight line in the terminal, with the number of characters specified by `n`.

### 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
- This program defines a function `print_diagonal` that prints a diagonal line in the terminal, with the number of backslashes specified by `n`.

### 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch
- This program defines a function `print_square` that prints a square in the terminal, with the size specified by `size`.

### 9. Fizz-Buzz
- This program prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."

### 10. Triangles
- This program defines a function `print_triangle` that prints a triangle in the terminal, with the size specified by `size`.

### 11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic (Advanced)
- This program finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.

### 12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper (Advanced)
- This program defines a function `print_number` that prints an integer.
