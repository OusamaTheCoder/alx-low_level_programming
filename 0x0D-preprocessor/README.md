---

**Author**: `OusamaTheCoder`


This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of preprocessor macros in the C programming language.

## List of Tasks

### 0. Object-like Macro
- **File**: `0-object_like_macro.h`
- Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

### 1. Pi
- **File**: `1-pi.h`
- Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

### 2. File name
- **File**: `2-main.c`
- Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

### 3. Function-like Macro
- **File**: `3-function_like_macro.h`
- Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### 4. SUM
- **File**: `4-sum.h`
- Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

Enjoy exploring these C programs related to preprocessor macros!
