- **Why C Programming Is Awesome:** Discover why C is considered an essential language in the world of programming.
- **Learning to program in C part 1 & 2:** Step-by-step guides to get you started with C programming.
- **Understanding C program Compilation Process:** Dive into the compilation process of C programs.
- **Betty Coding Style:** Learn about the official C coding style and how to ensure your code adheres to it.
- **Hash-bang under the hood:** A deeper look at the hash-bang mechanism.
- **Linus Torvalds on C vs. C++:** Insights from Linus Torvalds on the C vs. C++ debate.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:
- Why C programming is considered awesome.
- The contributions of Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds to the world of programming.
- The compilation process in C programming.
- Understanding the role of an entry point and the significance of the `main` function.
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- Calculating the size of specific data types using the `sizeof` operator.
- Compiling C code using `gcc` with an understanding of default program names.
- Adhering to the official C coding style and using the `betty` tool.
- Identifying the correct header files for standard library functions.
- Explaining how the `main` function influences the return value of a C program.

## Requirements
### C
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific options.
- All files must end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository and project folder.
- No compilation errors or warnings.
- Avoid using the `system` function.

### Shell Scripts
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Testing on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All scripts exactly two lines long.
- All files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be `#!/bin/bash`.

## Betty Linter
To maintain code quality, you can use the `betty` linter, which ensures adherence to the official C coding style.
