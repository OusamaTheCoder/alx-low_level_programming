## C Programming - Dynamic Memory Allocation and Deallocation

**Author**: `OusamaTheCoder`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various concepts related to dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc` and `free`. These programs cover topics such as creating arrays of characters, duplicating strings, concatenating strings, allocating and freeing 2-dimensional grids, and splitting strings into words.

## List of Programs

### 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
- This program includes a function `create_array` that creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.

### 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings
- This program includes a function `_strdup` that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, containing a copy of the given string.

### 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
- This program includes a function `str_concat` that concatenates two strings.

### 3. If you even dream of beating me, you'd better wake up and apologize
- This program includes a function `alloc_grid` that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers, with each element initialized to 0.

### 4. It's not bragging if you can back it up
- This program includes a function `free_grid` that frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by the `alloc_grid` function.

### 5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe (Advanced)
- This program includes a function `argstostr` that concatenates all the arguments of the program.

### 6. I will show you how great I am (Advanced)
- This program includes a function `strtow` that splits a string into words.

Enjoy exploring these C programs related to dynamic memory allocation and deallocation!
