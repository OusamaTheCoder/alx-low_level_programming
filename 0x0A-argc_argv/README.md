## C Programming - Command Line Arguments

**Author**: `OusamaTheCoder`

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of command line arguments (`argc` and `argv`) in C programming. Each program focuses on a specific task that involves processing command line arguments.

## List of Programs

### 0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to
- This program prints the name of the program itself.

### 1. Silence is argument carried out by other means
- This program prints the number of arguments passed into it.

### 2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter
- This program prints all the arguments it receives, each on a separate line.

### 3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument
- This program multiplies two numbers and prints the result. If the program doesn't receive two arguments, it prints an error message.

### 4. To infinity and beyond
- This program adds positive numbers and prints the result. If the program doesn't receive any numbers or encounters non-digit symbols, it prints an error message.

### 5. Minimal Number of Coins for Change (Advanced)
- This program calculates the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount of money in cents.
