## C Programming - Debugging

**Author**: `Ousama`

This repository contains C programs that have been debugged to fix issues or errors. Each program demonstrates debugging techniques to resolve common programming problems.

## List of Programs

### 0. Multiple mains
- This program tests the function `positive_or_negative()` and is designed to check if the function gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

### 1. Like, comment, subscribe
- This program causes an infinite loop and the task is to comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop without adding or removing lines of code.

### 2. 0 > 972?
- This program prints the largest of three integers, but it currently has an issue. The task is to fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers.

### 3. Leap year
- This program converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap years into consideration. The task is to fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that it works correctly for all dates and leap years.

Enjoy exploring these C programs and the debugging techniques used to make them work correctly!
